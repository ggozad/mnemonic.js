# mnemonic.js

mnemonic.js creates random passphrases (or hexadecimal uids) of specified strength which you *can* actually remember.

## Huh? My passwords are fine.

Probably not. Your passwords are either not random, or they are not long enough. Or, maybe you are one of those people who **really** do have a strong memory, but most of us do not.

Strong, secure passwords need to have an entropy of at least ~80 bits. Here are some real life considerations:

 * If we take truly random passwords from the entire ASCII printable set, we get an entropy of about 6.5 bits/character. That means, you need about 12 randomly chosen characters among the entire set to be ok. Not easy.

 * When you use non-random passwords your entropy/character reduces dramatically. For English, it's about 2 bits/character. You need a lot of characters to get there! And no, adding 1 at the end or using *1337* speak does not help much, dictionary attacks have been countering these techniques for a while now.

## Mnemonic.js passwords

mnemonic.js passwords consist of random sequences of words that are not so hard to remember. They have the advantage that you choose how strong you want them to be. Let's see some examples:

For your casual gaming site you might want to create a 32-bit password. A random one from mnemonic.js is

    confidence ourselves insult

It's equivalent to the integer `652372173`, `26e268cd` in hex, or `JuJozQ==` in base64 encoding.

For your passphrase you might want a stonger key. Here's a 96-bit example

    mean yesterday gone size waist lace endless apple war

corresponging to the integer `24224384090962230467342891306`, or `4e45f0dced5ec11c772ff92a` in hex, or `TkXw3O1ewRx3L/kq` in base64.

## I am sold. How does this work?

mnemonic.js uses a relatively small (1626 to be exact) set of English words that are chosen from the [list](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Contemporary_poetry) of frequently used words in contemporary English poetry and are (hopefully) memorable. An alternative set of English words has been added called `bitcoinSubset`. This list is a subset of the words used by crypto wallet passphrase generators.

To generate a passphrase, a random sequence of 32-bit unsigned integers is generated. The bigger the length of the sequence the stronger it is, for example 4 integers will give you 128-bit strong password. This sequence is then transformed to a list of words from the dictionary, 3 words per integer. The function that transforms the integer `x[i]` to the indices `w[i, j]` of the words is the following (1:1 and reversible) function:

    w[i,1] = x mod n,
    w[i,2] = (x / n + w[i,1]) mod n,
    w[i,3] = (x / n^2 + w[i,2]) mod n,

where `n=1626` is the number of words. The sequence of words is then given by:

    words = [ dict[w[i,1]], dict[w[i,2]], dict[w[i,3]] for each i ].

As mentioned, you can also do the reverse, i.e. from the list of words calculate the random sequence that produced it. For each triplet of words `word[i,1]`, `word[i,2]`, `word[i,3]`, the integer that corresponds to the triplet is calculated as such:

    w[i,1] = dict.indexOf(word[i,1])
    w[i,2] = dict.indexOf(word[i,2])
    w[i,3] = dict.indexOf(word[i,3])
    x = w[i,1] + n((w[i,2] - w[i,1]) mod n) + n^2 ((w[i,3] - w[i,2]) mod n)

## How do I use it?

Generate for example a 96-bit password, i.e. 9 words or 3 random 32-bit unsigned integers,

```javascript

    m = new Mnemonic(96);
    m.toWords();
    ["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"]

```

To use an alternate list:

```javascript

    m = new Mnemonic(96, 'bitcoinSubset');
    m.toWords();
    ["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"]

```

You can also obtain the random sequence, or the the 96-bit number in hexadecimal notation (useful if you need a uid that you can actually remember),

```javascript

    m.seed
    [174975897, 171815469, 1859322123]

    m.toHex();
    "0a6deb990a3db22d6ed3010b"

```

Finally, from a list of words or a hex string it is possible to recreate the `Mnemonic` that generated them:

```javascript

    m = Mnemonic.fromWords(["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"]);
    m.toHex();
    "0a6deb990a3db22d6ed3010b"

    m = Mnemonic.fromHex("0a6deb990a3db22d6ed3010b")
    m.toWords()
    ["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"]

```

Of course, if you generated using an alternate word list, you will need to specify that:

```javascript

    m = Mnemonic.fromWords(["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"], 'bitcoinSubset');
    m.toHex();
    "0a6deb990a3db22d6ed3010b"

    m = Mnemonic.fromHex("0a6deb990a3db22d6ed3010b")
    m.toWords('bitcoinSubset')
    ["grey", "climb", "demon", "snap", "shove", "fruit", "grasp", "hum", "self"]

```

## FAQ

 * *Why n=1626?*

    Because `n^3 = 4298942376` which is just over `2^32 = 4294967296` which makes the math work while keeping everything in nice multiples of 32 bits.

 * *How does this compare to [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)?*

    Diceware is very similar and will of course also create secure memorable phrases. It has the advantage of requiring slightly less words (~12.9 bits/word as opposed to ~10.6 for mnemonic.js) and is also easier to work with without a computer. However, it has a longer list of words (7776) many of which I find impossible to remember ;).

 * *Can I do this in my language?*

    Of course you can! If you happen to make a list of 1626 memorable words in your own language I promise to include it.
